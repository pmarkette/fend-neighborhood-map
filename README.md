This is project 5 for the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree. The principle objective was for me to learn MVC, MVVM, MV* etc design structures. The requirement for this project were to use Knockout.js to develop a single page application that reads in a collection of locations from a source (model) and display them on a dynamic google map.

Please click the link above and you will see a list of breweries and beer gardens in Oakland, CA. Clicking on any item in the list will highlight it on the map. You can use the search box to narrow down the list.
